# Ml-Project-sem-5

In this project, we analyzed customer purchase behavior using a retail dataset to extract insights, preprocess data, and develop predictive models for forecasting purchasing patterns.

 Purchase Prediction: We removed outliers and used an ensemble approach, combining models like Decision Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest, and CatBoost Regressor, to predict customer purchase amounts, weighting each model by its RÂ² score.
 
Product Recommendation: For predicting the type of products customers are likely to buy, we applied k-Means clustering to provide the top 5 product recommendations based on customer segmentation.
